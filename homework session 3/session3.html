             <p><strong> The City of Light draws millions of visitors every year with its unforgettable ambiance.
                 Of course, the divine cuisine and vast art collections deserve some of the credit as well.
                  The gentle River Seine rambles through the city, flanked by stately museums, 
                  centuries-old churches, and blocks of Rococo- and Neoclassic-design architecture, 
                  further enhanced by cascading trees and glowing streetlamps. 
                  Peppering the Seine's cobbled walks and graceful bridges are impossibly chic Parisians,
                 probably on their way to the market, cafe or cinema. </strong></p>

            <p><strong>Tokyo is a modern city built on tradition. 
                Soaring skyscrapers sit side by side with perfectly preserved shrines and temples.
                The city’s old traditions live on through food and festivals you can experience today.
                 Turn the corner on one of Tokyo’s streets and you could be transported back to the bygone Edo Period (1603-1867),
                 turn another, and you could find yourself in the heart of a subculture hub that’s out of this world. </strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Start Planning Early</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>The magic of budget travel starts with a little foresight.
                         By giving yourself ample time,
                          you can research and compare destinations, 
                          flights, accommodations, and activities, 
                          build a budget, and save for the trip.
                          planning early gives you time to track and compare prices. 
                          Tourism sites like Booking.com, Airbnb, Turo,
                           and others offer early bird discounts for booking a certain number of days in advance.
                          You’ll almost always save by booking train or bus tickets in advance,
                           starting as much as 12 weeks before the travel date.</strong></p>

                <p><strong> When packing for a vacation the most important things to keep in mind are 
                            the length of your trip, the weather, and any non-standart clothing or gear you might need.
                            Ensuring you pack the proper clothing is essential for comfort,
                             style, and adaptability during your travels. Transfer toiletries into 
                             travel-sized containers to save space and comply with TSA carry-on rules.
                             Include essentials like toothpaste, toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.
                             Don't forget to also protect yourself from harmful UV rays and pesky bugs with 
                             sunscreen and insect repellent.

                            You get to do what you want, when you want.
                            You can connect with people if you wish or avoid them completely.
                            here are many benefits of solo travel that affect your whole life.
                             The experience encourages you to stretch and grow as a person. 
                             You gain confidence and get better at problem solving.
                             You understand yourself better, become more independent, 
                            and become a more interesting person.</strong></p>
